# Vision-Based-Fire-Detection

The project is named “Fire Guard (Vision Based Fire Detection)”. The aim of this project is to detect the fire at an early stage to reduce the damage of properties and loss of human life. This project is built using Deep Learning Techniques, to reduce the false alarms which are caused due to the complexity of the scenes under observation, irregular lighting, and low-quality frames using vision and motion-based fire detection. The whole project is divided into 4 major steps, namely Data Collection, Data Preprocessing and Data Augmentation, Model Building and Model Selection, Classification and Prediction. The model which we have used to develop this project is the CNN model (Convolutional Neural Network) because CNN model is best for Image Classification and Image Recognition and also CNN model gives best accuracy on testing dataset. 
This project is based on real time video surveillance, while capturing the video if any fire is detected then it will convert the frames into gray-scale images and also a warning sound will beep to let the administrator or the user of the system know that the fire is detected. So that quick actions can be taken to control the fire which will help to reduce the loss and damage of the surroundings
